# Cofounding Variables with Wine Quality <img src="img/wine.jpg" align="right" width="120" />
> Confounding variables (also known as lurking variables) are essentially factors that affect both the dependent and independent variables. Failing to account for these confounders could lead to incorrect conclusions when doing analysis for the dataset.\
> This excersise will assess confounding in the Wine quality Datasets taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rajyellow46/wine-quality).
